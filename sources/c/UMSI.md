**Sample Course Sequencing:**

**Big Data Analytics:**

Students interested in working towards a mastery course in Big Data Analytics will take courses towards mastery of data collection, processing, analysis, retrieval, mining, visualization, and prediction. Students synthesize methods from information retrieval, statistical data analysis, data mining, machine learning, and other big-data related fields. They work on semester-long projects that deal with industry-scale data sets and solve real-world problems. Aligned with best industry practices, students are expected to work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and to demonstrate independence and leadership. Students must be able to create and use tools to handle very large transactional, text, network, behavioral, and/or multimedia data sets.

*Selective Requirement: Must choose at least 2 of these courses

**Students can count up to 9 credits (3 courses) of cognates towards the MSI

 

UMSI elective or broader UM cognate choices are quite wide open for students to pursue interest areas, although some cognates may have limited availability. Elective and cognate choices provide an opportunity for students to gain additional depth in an area or to add breadth.

 

*Cognate Examples:*

Students with an interest in Big Data Analytics will often select their non-UMSI elective courses in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) or other Engineering departments, Ross School of Business, Statistics, Math, Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Ford School of Public Policy, Law, Health Sciences, Public Health, and others.

 

*Elective Examples:*

Within the School of Information course offerings, students often choose courses in management, user experience, social computing, and information economics. Sample course titles include Principles in Management, Information and Control, Citizen Interaction Design, Introduction to Interaction Design, Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation, Fundamentals of Human Behavior, Graphic Design, Design of Complex Websites, Personal Informatics Design, Social User Experience, Game Theory, Information Economics, Choice Architecture,Theories of Social Influence, and others.

 

**User Experience Research and Design:**

Students interested in working towards a mastery course in User Experience (UX) Research and Design will take courses towards mastery of application of design theories, concepts, and principles to defining valid problems, uncovering user needs, articulating service requirements, documenting UX research results, proposing, refining, and prototyping design solutions, and communicating with stakeholders effectively. Students will have individual and group real-world opportunities to engage in portfolio building projects that integrate methods and theories about user experience design from identifying design issues to developing design solutions.

Please note of the following policies regarding the application of the GDP programs:

1. Students can apply to up to two GDP partner universities: U-M is considered to be one partner university. Please note this does not apply to senior students, meaning senior students can apply to multiple GDP programs.
2. All the requirements mentioned in the announcements are considered as recommended. Students can apply to the programs with whatever GPA, TOEFL scores and others they have.
3. Students must register with International Programs Office for the application of the GDP programs, otherwise the application will be considered as disqualified, meaning only students who complete the signup form here are allowed to continue their applications forward with different GDP Programs. 
4. Students are allowed to fill up the registration for multiple times.

 

 

 

Please visit the International Programs Office at Room 301, JI Building if you have any questions.
